# This is an excercise with examples for devops practice. 
If you are able to set up Azure Devops, create the right variables, build, and deploy the contents of the repo (instruction steps below), it will result in a webshop, where if you "buy" something you will actually get it for free. 

# Steps
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.  Make sure you have a Visual Studio Professional subscription	
2.  Create your own active directory and transfer your azure subscription into you directory
3.	Create an Azure Devops instance
4.	Import this git repo into your azure devops
5.	Set up the pipelines and variables, a unique name/url for your web application, and authorize the pipeline tasks with your subscription
5.i Build pipeline is in the `azure-pipelines.yml` the release pipeline is in the `Assets` folder `Release.json`
6.	Run the pipeline, and check the results
7.  Buy something in your deployed webshop
